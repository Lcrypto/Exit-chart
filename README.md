# Exit-chart
The GitHub repository contains a tool for estimating the iterative decoding threshold of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes using degree distribution, developed by Stephan ten Brink. This tool provides a more general description of LDPC codes ensemble compared to protographs.

The implementation is based on two papers. The first paper is "Convergence behavior of iteratively decoded parallel concatenated codes" by S. ten Brink, published in the IEEE Transactions on Communications in October 2001. The second paper is "The exit chart - introduction to extrinsic information transfer in iterative processing" by J. Hagenauer, presented at the 12th European Signal Processing Conference in 2004.

With this tool, you can estimate the iterative decoding threshold of LDPC codes based on their degree distribution. This provides valuable information for designing LDPC codes that can achieve high performance in iterative decoding.
